And maybe one day y’all can work together.’ And that was how we met,” she explained.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-912 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>It was definitely not love at first sight for the two, however. Keys told Marie Claire UK that she really didn’t want anything to do with the DJ at the time. “Honestly, I didn’t really like him that much,” she told the magazine. “I thought he was too ostentatious.”</p><p>“Swizz will have the fastest car, the biggest jewelry, the loudest jacket,” she explains. “Everything with him is really over the top. I used to see him and think, ‘He is so annoying.'”</p><p>That all changed when the duo reconnected around 2008, although there was some controversy over their love connection as Dean was still married to R&B singer Mashonda Tifrere at the time.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-913 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Dean and Keys suggest the marriage was over and the couple separated before they connected, but Mashonda at the time stated that wasn’t the case, writing an open letter to the singer on social media.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>“I made it very clear that on the contrary of what she might be hearing, I am still married to my husband, living with him, and just had a child,” she wrote. “It’s been two years and I still have not received a response.”</p><p>Keys and Dean married in 2010 and fortunately, the blended family were able to repair their relationship and have built a solid co-parenting plan, formed a friendship, and have even gone on vacations together for the sake of their children.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-914 data-method=placement-service></span><h2>Egypt Daoud Dean Mother Alicia Keys</h2><p>Alicia Augello Cook (born January 25, 1981), known professionally as <strong>Alicia Keys</strong>, is an American musician, singer, and songwriter.
