On the surface of it, my language in the film is full of four-letter words, but that's mixed with a kind of poetic elegance. It's terribly subtle, but the tune, the lilt, is still very Irish even though it's New York slang. It gives a kind of pelt bristling beneath the cloth.</td></tr><tr readability=8.6086956521739><td>3</td><td>[on his character Jackie from <a href=#>State of Grace</a> (1990)] He's a sweetheart. I miss him. I just think he needs a good cuddle. [laughs] He's a very tormented soul, Jackie. The reason I like characters like him is that they are bright, they're passionate, they have got the gift of gab. I mean, Jackie should go to drama school!</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>4</td><td>Sometimes not getting a role ends up being the best thing. When a project turns out to be a disaster, you look at it and go, "Wow, I dodged a bullet there."</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>5</td><td>More and more, people in this culture are able to hide behind comedy and satire to say things we can't ordinarily say, because it's all too politically correct.</td></tr><tr readability=19.044459190445><td>6</td><td>Now we're in this thing where everything has to be analyzed and dissected behind the scenes. I personally never want to know how the guy pulls the rabbit out of the hat. I don't need people prying. Maybe I'm shy. I don't know. You look at a movie like <a href=#>Hannibal</a> (2001), and even with all that make-up, it was the most free I've ever been. I think it's because I was hidden. On the other side of that coin, the most stressful role, the most painful to do, was Smiley in <a href=#>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</a> (2011). There's no mask. It's very exposed. You have to play boring in an interesting way. Not that Smiley is a boring character, but he's plain. Everything is dialed way down. You look at something like _The Professional_ or <a href=#>True Romance</a> (1993) or even <a href=#>State of Grace</a> (1990), and there's a kinetic sort of ferocity and a fire to those characters, where the volume is up. I understand why Alec Guinness had a kind of nervous breakdown leading up to the shooting of the original Tinker Tailor and wanted out. I had a breakdown too, briefly. At first I passed on the movie, but then I couldn't stop thinking about it. Once I signed on, I thought, Fuck me! I can't do this. I can't pull this off. Everybody's going to see what a fake I am. This is the moment I get found out. Who does he think he is? He thinks he's <a href=#>Alec Guinness</a>. Now, normally I agonize after a movie, not before. I'll walk down a street and suddenly I'm thinking of a scene I did two years ago. I'll go, "That's how I should have done that line."</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>7</td><td>I know it certainly doesn't mean anything to win a Golden Globe, that's for sure. It's a meaningless event. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association is kidding you that something's happening. They're fucking ridiculous. There's nothing going on at all. It's 90 nobodies having a wank. Everybody's getting drunk, and everybody's sucking up to everybody. Boycott the fucking thing. Just say we're not going to play this silly game with you anymore. The Oscars are different. But it's showbiz. It's all showbiz. That makes me sound like I've got sour grapes or something, doesn't it?</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>8</td><td>I just think political correctness is crap. That's what I think about it. I think it's like, take a fucking joke. Get over it. I heard about a science teacher who was teaching that God made the earth and God made everything and that if you believe anything else you're stupid. A Buddhist kid in the class got very upset about this, so the parents went in and are suing the school! The school is changing its curriculum! I thought, All right, go to the school and complain about it and then that's the end of it. But they're going to sue! No one can take a joke anymore.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>9</td><td>There's a lot of rubbish talked about acting, and it's often propagated by practitioners of it. You just want to say, "Oh, shut up."</td></tr><tr readability=7.5666666666667><td>10</td><td>[on <a href=#>Air Force One</a> (1997)] That movie had some enjoyable moments. I remember the flight deck was on a sound stage and there was a big sign that said "No Drinking, No Smoking and No Eating On Set." At one point I looked over and [<a href=#>Harrison Ford</a>] was in the doorway beneath the sign with a burrito, a cigar and a cup of coffee, which I thought was hilarious. I could never get the image out of my head. Nowadays we would take out an iPhone and post something like that on Instagram.</td></tr><tr readability=14.497><td>11</td><td>I'm trying to give my sons an education about movies as well. You sit there and watch a comedy, let's say <a href=#>Meet the Fockers</a> (2004), and it's <a href=#>Robert De Niro</a>. You tell them this guy was at one time considered the greatest living actor. My boys look at me and say, "Really? This guy? He's a middle-aged dad." So what I've tried to do recently is introduce them one by one to the great movies of the 1970s - <a href=#>The Godfather</a> (1972), <a href=#>Mean Streets</a> (1973), <a href=#>The Deer Hunter</a> (1978), <a href=#>Dog Day Afternoon</a> (1975), the work of <a href=#>Lindsay Anderson</a>, <a href=#>Francis Ford Coppola</a>, <a href=#>Martin Scorsese</a>, <a href=#>Gene Hackman</a>, <a href=#>Al Pacino</a>, <a href=#>John Cazale</a>, <a href=#>Peter Sellers</a>. I try to give them a sense of what cinema used to be like rather than just these tent-pole movies that come and go on demand within five minutes. Don't get me wrong; there are directors I would still want to work with - <a href=#>Wes Anderson</a>, <a href=#>Paul Thomas Anderson</a>. I've never worked with <a href=#>Todd Haynes</a>. I love <a href=#>John Sayles</a>. I've never worked with Scorsese.
