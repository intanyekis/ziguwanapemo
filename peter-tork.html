He was the funniest Monkee, their Ringo, their truest hippie, always happy to pitch in with a banjo solo or a bit of his dazed flower-child wisdom. This man knew how to rock a black-velvet silver-button tunic. That’s why fans around the world are grieving&nbsp;his death Thursday&nbsp;at 77. As he promised all those years ago in “For Pete’s Sake,” he made the world shine.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-919 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span><p><strong>Source:www.rollingstone.com</strong></p><h3>Hear a Celebration of Peter Tork’s Life and Music</h3><p>The latest episode of our Rolling Stone Music Now podcast celebrates the life and music of Peter Tork, with previously unheard interview audio and more.

We want those fans to know with absolute certainty that your spirit and goodwill fed Peter with continued energy and force (and of course humor).”</p><p>The family asked fans to make a donation to The Institute for The Musical Arts in Massachusetts in Tork’s name.

I have said this before — and now it seems even more apt — the reason we called it a band is because it was where we all went to play,” Nesmith shared on Facebook. “A band no more — and yet the music plays on — an anthem to all who made the Monkees and the TV show our private — dare I say ‘secret’ — playground. As for Pete, I can only pray his songs to reach the heights that can lift us and that our childhood lives forever — that special sparkle that was the Monkees. I will miss him — a brother in arms.
